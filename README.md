# CS-340-Portfolio-Submission

## Overview
This repository is for the assignment '8-2 Journal: Portfolio Item' in the course CS350 Client and Server Development. This is a way to reflect on and showcase some of the work completed in this course.

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists develop computer systems and their application. This includes designing, testing, and improving existing and new technologies. This type of work matters for many reasons, but probably the most significant being the vast innovations and advancements we have had in technology in the past century. Things like cell phones, self driving vehicles, personal computers, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and many more would have not been possible without computer scientists. Computer scientists are also significant because they can help solve complex problems. This is how they can help companies like Grazioso Salvare, by developing an application that makes their work much more quick and efficient. With the use of the developed application, this could potentially save hundreds of hours from manually having to search through the given rescue animal data. With this saved time, the company can utilize this time with their more important goal which is helping/rescuing people.
